# StarOS
An OS for my ComputerBound mod.

The design goal for this is to provide the minimum amount of functionality an OS requires to be considered usable
without being aggressively barebones; that is to say, it should have a small core and featureset, but shouldn't
make someone have to literally write new code for everything just to get a small program going.

I would refrain from calling this the "default" OS for the mod. It would be as if calling Windows or Linux or MacOS
the "default" OS for computers. This particular OS will only be one of (what I hope to be) many OSs' made by
various users.
